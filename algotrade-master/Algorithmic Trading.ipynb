    "Support is a concept in finance which refers to the historically observed lower bound of the price of a stock. The stock price rarely goes below this level. If the stock price decreases and hits the support, it either bounces back (decreases till the stock price is equal to the support and then increases), in which case the support remains unchanged, or it passes through the support and goes on decreasing till a new support is established, using recent data. Buyers buy shares of a stock near the support level, since it is thought that the prices of a stock will not decrease beyond the support level.\n",

If the stock price increases, it either bounces off the resistance level, thus confirming it, or passes through till a new resistance level has been established. Both resistance and support are characterized by straight lines. Sellers sell shares when a stock is at its resistance level, since prices rarely go above the resistance level."

Once we have determined the equations of the straight lines, we try to find out the time intervals in the near future till which the given support and resistance levels are obeyed by the data. We determine these time intervals for different values of $l$, where $l$ is the number of previous data points used to calculate the support and resistance equations. We then use all these values to find out an empirical distribution of the time intervals till which the stock prices stay within the support and resistance levels."
